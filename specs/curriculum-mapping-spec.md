## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document is the **authoritative reference** for developers implementing question generation, difficulty scaling, and progression logic in Classe Master. It maps every sub-level and micro-level to precise numerical ranges, skill expectations, question types, and timing parameters.

Every question generated by the system must conform to the ranges and constraints defined here. No question should fall outside the specified operand ranges, result ranges, or topic boundaries for a given (level, sub-level, micro-level) tuple.

### 1.2 Structure

The game spans **5 levels**, each corresponding to a year of French primary school:

| Level | French Year | Age | UK Equivalent |
|-------|------------|-----|---------------|
| CP | Cours Preparatoire (Cycle 2, Year 1) | 6 | Year 1 (partial Year 2) |
| CE1 | Cours Elementaire 1 (Cycle 2, Year 2) | 7 | Year 2 (partial Year 3) |
| CE2 | Cours Elementaire 2 (Cycle 2, Year 3) | 8 | Year 3 (partial Year 4) |
| CM1 | Cours Moyen 1 (Cycle 3, Year 1) | 9 | Year 4 (partial Year 5) |
| CM2 | Cours Moyen 2 (Cycle 3, Year 2) | 10 | Year 5 (partial Year 6) |

Each level contains:
- **10 sub-levels** (SL1 through SL10) -- broad difficulty bands mapped to periods of the school year
- **10 micro-levels** (ML1 through ML10) per sub-level -- fine-grained difficulty steps within each sub-level

**Total: 5 levels x 10 sub-levels x 10 micro-levels = 500 discrete difficulty steps.**

### 1.3 How to Read the Tables

Each sub-level section specifies, for every active topic:

1. **Topic code** (e.g., CP-ADD)
2. **Number range** for that topic at that sub-level
3. **Skills** being tested
4. **Question types** used (MC = multiple choice, FIB = fill-in-blank, FI = free input, WP = word problem, TF = true/false, CMP = comparison)
5. **Micro-level progression table** showing how parameters change from ML1 to ML10
6. **Example questions** at representative micro-levels
7. **Common mistakes** to use for distractor generation

The micro-level tables use these columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Operand A range | Min-max for the first operand |
| Operand B range | Min-max for the second operand |
| Result range | Min-max for the expected answer |
| Carry/borrow | Whether regrouping is required (Yes/No/Sometimes) |
| Formats | Which question types are active at this micro-level |
| Time per Q (s) | Maximum soft timer in seconds |
| Distractor closeness | How close distractors are to the correct answer |

Where only representative micro-levels are shown (ML1, ML3, ML5, ML7, ML10), intermediate values should be **linearly interpolated** by the question generator.

### 1.4 Topic Code System

Topic codes follow the pattern: `{LEVEL}-{TOPIC}`. Each topic gets a 3-letter abbreviation.

| Code | Topic |
|------|-------|
| CNT | Counting & Number Sense |
| ADD | Addition |
| SUB | Subtraction |
| MUL | Multiplication |
| DIV | Division |
| FRC | Fractions |
| DEC | Decimals |
| GEO | Shapes & Geometry |
| MSR | Measurement (length, mass, capacity) |
| TIM | Time |
| MON | Money |
| ORD | Ordering & Comparing Numbers |
| PER | Perimeter |
| ARE | Area |
| ANG | Angles |
| SYM | Symmetry |
| PRP | Proportionality |
| PCT | Percentages |
| DAT | Data & Statistics |
| ALG | Algebra |

**Examples:** `CP-ADD` = CP Addition, `CE1-MUL` = CE1 Multiplication, `CM2-FRC` = CM2 Fractions.

Not all topics are active at all levels. The per-level sections specify exactly which topics are available and at which sub-levels they are introduced.

### 1.5 Mastery Criteria Summary

| Transition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Micro-level to next | 80% accuracy on rolling window of last 10 questions, minimum 8 questions answered |
| Sub-level to next | All 10 micro-levels completed, 85% weighted average across all micros, gate quiz 8/10 |
| Level to next | All 10 sub-levels completed, 85% weighted average, level exam 16/20, no topic below 70% |

## 2. Progression & Mastery Rules

### 2.1 Micro-Level Advancement

A student advances from micro-level N to micro-level N+1 within a sub-level when:

1. **Minimum volume:** At least **8 questions** have been answered at the current micro-level.
2. **Rolling accuracy:** The accuracy over the **last 10 questions** at this micro-level is at least **80%** (i.e., 8 out of 10 correct).
3. **No catastrophic streak:** No more than **2 consecutive errors** on the same sub-topic within the micro-level.
4. **Hint penalty:** Questions answered with 2 or more hints count as only **50%** toward the accuracy numerator. Example: 10 questions answered, 8 correct but 4 used 2+ hints. Effective score = (4 unaided correct) + (4 assisted x 0.5) = 6 effective correct out of 10 = 60%. Student does NOT advance.

**When a student fails to advance:**
- They remain at the current micro-level.
- The question generator increases the proportion of sub-topics where errors occurred (targeted practice).
- After **3 failed advancement attempts** (3 consecutive windows of 10 where accuracy stays below 80%), the system triggers a **review session** drawing questions from the previous micro-level to rebuild foundations.

### 2.2 Sub-Level Advancement

A student advances from sub-level N to sub-level N+1 when:

1. **Completion:** All 10 micro-levels of the current sub-level have been completed (i.e., the student has advanced through ML1 to ML10).
2. **Weighted average:** The **weighted average accuracy** across all 10 micro-levels is at least **85%**. The weighting is: ML1-ML3 weight 0.8, ML4-ML7 weight 1.0, ML8-ML10 weight 1.2 (higher micro-levels count more).
3. **Gate quiz:** A **gate quiz** of 10 questions is presented, drawing 1 question from each micro-level. The student must score at least **8/10**.

**When a student fails the gate quiz:**
- The system identifies which micro-levels had errors.
- The student must redo those specific micro-levels (targeted remediation, not the entire sub-level).
- The gate quiz can be re-attempted after remediation.

### 2.3 Level Advancement

A student advances from one main level (e.g., CP) to the next (e.g., CE1) when:

1. **Completion:** All 10 sub-levels of the current level are completed.
2. **Weighted average:** The overall accuracy across all sub-levels is at least **85%**.
3. **Level exam:** A **level-up exam** of 20 questions is presented, with at least 2 questions per sub-level and at least 1 question per active topic. The student must score at least **16/20 (80%)**.
4. **No critical gaps:** No single topic may have an accuracy below **70%** in the exam. If any topic falls below 70%, the student is directed to review that topic before re-attempting.

### 2.4 Spaced Repetition Schedule

Once a sub-level or topic is mastered, review questions from it continue to appear according to this schedule:

| Days Since Mastery | Review Questions per Session |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 |
| 14 | 1 |
| 30 | 1 |
| 60+ | 1 per month |

If a review question is answered incorrectly, the schedule **resets to Day 1** for that specific sub-topic.

### 2.5 Adaptive Difficulty Within Sessions

Each 5-minute session draws questions from **multiple active topics**. The topic mix is weighted by student need:

| Student Status on Topic | Question Allocation |
|---|---|
| Behind (accuracy < 70% on last 20 questions) | 40-50% of session, with 2x question allocation |
| On track (accuracy 70-85%) | 30-40% of session |
| Ahead (accuracy > 85%) | 10-20% of session (maintenance) |

Within a topic, the system selects the student's current micro-level for new questions, plus occasional review questions from previously mastered micro-levels per the spaced repetition schedule.

### 2.6 Adaptive Difficulty Within a Micro-Level

If a student is answering questions significantly faster or more accurately than expected at their current micro-level, the system may apply **intra-micro-level adjustments**:

- **Faster students:** Reduce the soft timer by 10-20%, increase distractor closeness.
- **Struggling students:** Increase the soft timer by 10-20%, decrease distractor closeness, increase MC option frequency.

These adjustments do NOT change the operand ranges or result ranges -- those are fixed by the micro-level tables below. They only affect presentation difficulty.

##### CP-SUB at SL9: Subtraction (within 100, simpler cases)

**Skills:**
- Subtract within 100 for simpler cases:
  - Two-digit minus single-digit (e.g., 73 - 5 = 68)
  - Two-digit minus multiple of 10 (e.g., 85 - 30 = 55)
  - Two-digit minus two-digit without borrowing (e.g., 78 - 23 = 55)
- With borrowing only in simpler cases (e.g., 42 - 7 = 35)
