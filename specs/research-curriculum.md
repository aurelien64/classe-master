## 1. Structural Overview

### 1.1 French System (Programmes Officiels)

The French primary curriculum is organized into **cycles**:

| Cycle | Levels | Ages | Focus |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| Cycle 2 (Apprentissages fondamentaux) | CP, CE1, CE2 | 6-8 | Foundational learning |
| Cycle 3 (Consolidation) | CM1, CM2, 6e | 9-11 | Consolidation and deepening |

**Four main domains (2025 programmes):**
1. **Nombres, calcul et resolution de problemes** (Numbers, calculation and problem solving) -- minimum 2/3 of math instruction time
2. **Grandeurs et mesures** (Quantities and measurement)
3. **Espace et geometrie** (Space and geometry)
4. **Organisation et gestion de donnees** (Data organization and management) -- new in 2025

**Pedagogical approach:** Explicit, structured, and progressive teaching following a sequence: manipulation -> representation -> verbalization -> abstraction.

**Weekly hours:** Approximately 5 hours of mathematics per week in elementary school.

### 1.2 UK System (National Curriculum for England)

The UK primary curriculum is organized into **Key Stages**:

| Key Stage | Year Groups | Ages | Focus |
|-----------|-------------|------|-------|
| KS1 | Year 1, Year 2 | 5-7 | Foundational number and arithmetic |
| KS2 Lower | Year 3, Year 4 | 7-9 | Fluency with operations and place value |
| KS2 Upper | Year 5, Year 6 | 9-11 | Extended number system, fractions, decimals, percentages |

**Three core aims:**
1. **Fluency** in fundamentals of mathematics
2. **Mathematical reasoning** -- following lines of enquiry, conjecturing relationships
3. **Problem solving** -- applying mathematics to routine and non-routine problems

**Programmes of study are set out year by year** (unlike France which organizes by cycle with year-level detail).

## 4. Comparative Analysis

### 4.1 Number Range Progression

| Age | French Level | French Range | UK Level | UK Range |
|-----|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| 5-6 | - | - | Year 1 | 0-100 |
| 6 | CP | 0-100 | - | - |
| 7 | CE1 | 0-999 | Year 2 | 0-100 |
| 8 | CE2 | 0-10,000 | Year 3 | 0-1,000 |
| 9 | CM1 | 0-999,999 | Year 4 | 0-10,000+ |
| 10 | CM2 | 0-1,000,000,000 | Year 5 | 0-1,000,000 |
| 11 | (6eme) | - | Year 6 | 0-10,000,000 |

**Key difference:** France pushes number ranges significantly further, significantly faster from CE2 onwards. By CM2 (age 10), French students work up to one billion, while UK Year 5 students (same age) work to one million. However, the UK starts a year earlier (Year 1 at age 5 vs CP at age 6).

### 4.2 Multiplication Tables

| Age | French Level | Tables Expected | UK Level | Tables Expected |
|-----|-------------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| 6 | CP | Doubles only | Year 1 | Counting in 2s, 5s, 10s |
| 7 | CE1 | x2, x3, x4, x5 | Year 2 | x2, x5, x10 |
| 8 | CE2 | x2 through x9 (by heart) | Year 3 | Add x3, x4, x8 |
| 9 | CM1 | x2-x9 fluent | Year 4 | ALL to 12 x 12 (statutory test) |
| 10 | CM2 | x2-x9 maintained | Year 5 | 12 x 12 maintained |

**Key differences:**
- France requires tables x2-x9 by end of CE2 (age 8). UK requires ALL tables to 12 x 12 by end of Year 4 (age 9).
- UK goes further (up to 12x) but one year later.
- France focuses on x2-x9 (as the programme covers 2 to 9); the UK includes x11 and x12.
- UK has a **statutory Multiplication Tables Check (MTC)** at end of Year 4 -- a formal national test.
- France uses fluency tests but they are classroom-based (e.g., 15 results in 3 minutes).

### 4.3 Fractions Progression

| Age | French Level | Fractions | UK Level | Fractions |
|-----|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 5-6 | - | - | Year 1 | 1/2, 1/4 recognition |
| 6 | CP | "moitie", "demi", "quart" (words only) | - | - |
| 7 | CE1 | Unit fractions (1/2 to 1/10), non-unit fractions, compare, add/subtract same denom (all <= 1) | Year 2 | 1/3, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4; equivalence 2/4=1/2 |
| 8 | CE2 | Fractions <= 1, add/subtract same denom, number line | Year 3 | Tenths, equivalence, add/subtract same denom within 1 whole |
| 9 | CM1 | Denom <= 20, decimal fractions (10ths, 100ths), fractions > 1 | Year 4 | Hundredths, decimal equivalents, add/subtract same denom |
| 10 | CM2 | Denom <= 60, compare different denom, fraction-decimal links | Year 5 | Mixed numbers, add/subtract related denom, multiply by whole number, percentages |
| 11 | - | - | Year 6 | Multiply fraction x fraction, divide fraction by whole number, full equivalences |

**Key differences:**
- The 2025 French programme introduces fractions much earlier and more aggressively in CE1 (age 7), which is a major change from previous programmes.
- UK introduces percentages in Year 5 (age 9-10); France does not formally cover percentages in primary school (it comes in 6eme).
- UK Year 6 covers fraction multiplication (fraction x fraction) and division (fraction / whole number); France does not cover these operations in primary.
- UK has a more systematic fraction-decimal-percentage equivalence framework.

### 4.4 Decimals Progression

| Age | French Level | Decimals | UK Level | Decimals |
|-----|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| 7 | CE1 | Currency context only | Year 2 | Not introduced |
| 8 | CE2 | Add/subtract in money context | Year 3 | Tenths as fractions (foundation) |
| 9 | CM1 | To hundredths (2 d.p.); add/subtract | Year 4 | Tenths, hundredths; equivalents; round 1 d.p. |
| 10 | CM2 | To thousandths (3 d.p.); all operations | Year 5 | Thousandths; round 2 d.p.; ordering to 3 d.p.; percentages |
| 11 | - | - | Year 6 | Multiply/divide decimals; answers to 3 d.p.; full operations |

**Key difference:** Largely parallel progression. Both reach thousandths by age 10-11. France introduces decimal notation through money earlier (CE1) while the UK formally introduces tenths as fractions in Year 3 then decimals in Year 4.

### 4.5 Division Progression

| Age | French Level | Division | UK Level | Division |
|-----|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| 6 | CP | Sharing/grouping through problems | Year 1 | Grouping/sharing small quantities |
| 7 | CE1 | Sharing/grouping by 2 and 5 | Year 2 | x2, x5, x10 division facts |
| 8 | CE2 | Multi-step division problems | Year 3 | Mental; 2-digit / 1-digit |
| 9 | CM1 | Euclidean division introduced; written method | Year 4 | Formal; 2-3 digit / 1-digit |
| 10 | CM2 | Euclidean fully mastered; decimal division introduced | Year 5 | Short division up to 4-digit / 1-digit; remainders |
| 11 | - | - | Year 6 | Long division up to 4-digit / 2-digit |

**Key difference:** UK pushes written long division (4-digit / 2-digit) further in Year 6. France introduces Euclidean division formally in CM1 and decimal division in CM2.

### 4.6 Geometry Comparison

| Topic | France Introduction | UK Introduction |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Recognizing 2-D shapes | CP (age 6) | Year 1 (age 5) |
| Recognizing 3-D solids | CP (age 6) | Year 1 (age 5) |
| Right angles | CE1 (age 7) | Year 3 (age 7) |
| Perpendicular/parallel lines | CE2-CM1 (age 8-9) | Year 3 (age 7) |
| Symmetry | CE2 (age 8) | Year 2 (age 6) -- line symmetry |
| Acute/obtuse angles | CE2 (age 8) | Year 4 (age 8) |
| Measuring angles in degrees | CM2 (age 10) | Year 5 (age 9) |
| Coordinates | Not in primary | Year 4 (age 8) |
| Full 4-quadrant coordinates | Not in primary | Year 6 (age 10) |
| Nets of 3-D shapes | CM1-CM2 (age 9-10) | Year 6 (age 10) |
| Area of triangles/parallelograms | Not in primary | Year 6 (age 10) |
| Circle parts (radius, diameter) | Not in primary | Year 6 (age 10) |

**Key differences:**
- UK introduces coordinates (Year 4) and full 4-quadrant coordinates (Year 6) in primary; France does not.
- UK covers area formulae for triangles and parallelograms in Year 6; France defers this.
- UK covers circle parts (radius, diameter, circumference) in Year 6; France covers this more in 6eme.
- France emphasizes construction with tools (compass, set square) earlier and more thoroughly.
- France includes basic programming/algorithmic thinking for spatial reasoning from CM1.

### 4.7 Measurement Comparison

| Topic | France | UK |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Metric length units | cm, m (CP); mm (CE2); km (CM1) | m/cm (Y1); mm (Y3); km (Y4) |
| Mass units | kg, g (CE1) | kg/g (Y2) |
| Capacity units | L (CE2); mL, cL (CM1) | l/ml (Y2) |
| Money | Euro coins/notes (CP) | Coins/notes (Y1); pounds/pence (Y2) |
| Perimeter | CE2 (polygons) | Y3 (simple shapes) |
| Area (counting squares) | CM1 | Y4 |
| Area (formula) | Not in primary | Y5-6 (rectangles, triangles, parallelograms) |
| Volume | CM2 (introduction) | Y5-6 (cubes/cuboids in cm-cubed, m-cubed) |
| Imperial units | Not covered | Y5 (approximate equivalences: inches, pounds, pints, miles) |
| Conversion tables | Banned for student use (2025) | Not specifically addressed |

**Key differences:**
- UK includes approximate metric-imperial equivalences (Year 5); France does not cover imperial units.
- UK pushes area and volume formulae further in primary; France keeps area at the intuitive/counting level.
- France bans conversion tables for student use (2025 change) -- students must understand relationships without the table tool.

### 4.8 Topics Present in One Curriculum but Not the Other

**UK has, France does not (in primary):**
- Percentages (Year 5-6)
- Ratio and proportion (Year 6)
- Algebra as a named domain (Year 6)
- Coordinates and full 4-quadrant work (Year 4-6)
- Area formulae for triangles and parallelograms (Year 6)
- Mean as average (Year 6)
- Pie charts (Year 6)
- Imperial units (Year 5)
- Times tables up to 12 (France stops at 9)

**France has, UK does not (in primary):**
- Probability and randomness (CM1-CM2, introduced 2025)
- Algorithmic thinking and basic programming (CM1-CM2)
- Numbers up to 1 billion (CM2)
- Construction emphasis with compass, set square (earlier and more thorough)
- Euclidean division as a named concept
- Fractions from CE1 age 7 (2025 programme, earlier than UK Year 2)
- Ban on conversion tables (pedagogical approach)

## 5. Progression Within School Years

### 5.1 French System: Period-by-Period Progression

The French school year is divided into 5 periods (roughly 6-7 weeks each):
- **Period 1:** September - October (before Toussaint holidays)
- **Period 2:** November - December (before Christmas)
- **Period 3:** January - February
- **Period 4:** March - April (before spring holidays)
- **Period 5:** May - June (end of year)

#### CP Progression Example
| Period | Numbers | Calculation | Geometry/Measurement |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| P1 | 0-10 (decompositions) | Add/subtract 1 or 2; complements to 5 | Solid recognition; spatial vocabulary |
| P2 | 0-59 (tens + units) | Doubles to 10+10; complements to 10 | Plane shapes; length comparison |
| P3 | 0-100 | Add/subtract 10; 3-number addition | cm/m units; mass comparison |
| P4 | 0-100 (consolidation) | Written addition introduced; tables of addition | Money (making amounts); time (hours) |
| P5 | 0-100 (mastery) | All addition strategies; composed addition | Duration; measurement applications |

#### CE1 Progression Example
| Period | Numbers | Calculation | New Concepts |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| P1 | 0-59 | Addition tables; mental add/subtract small numbers | Ruler/compass/set square; fractions 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... |
| P2 | 0-99 | Written addition (no regrouping); 2-digit add in line | Non-unit fractions; numerator/denominator vocab |
| P3 | Knowing 100; counting by 5s | Written addition WITH regrouping (3-digit); written subtraction introduced | Right angle coding; comparing fractions |
| P4 | 0-999 | Written subtraction with/without regrouping (3-digit); multiplication word problems | Money, time, solids |
| P5 | 0-999 (knowing 1000) | Multiplication meaning; tables through x5; multiply by 10 | Fraction add/subtract same denom; clock reading |

#### CM1 Progression Example
| Period | Numbers | Calculation | New Concepts |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| P1-P2 | Whole numbers to 4 digits | Written +/-/x with whole numbers; Euclidean division introduced | Fractions (denom <= 20); decimal fractions begin |
| P3-P4 | Whole numbers to 5-6 digits | Decimal add/subtract (to hundredths); division consolidated | Decimal notation; angles; perimeter; area introduction |
| P5 | Full range to 999,999 | All operations consolidated | Proportionality; probability introduction |

### 5.2 UK System: Term-by-Term Progression

UK schools typically organize the year into 3 terms (Autumn, Spring, Summer) or 6 half-terms:
- **Autumn 1:** September - October
- **Autumn 2:** November - December
- **Spring 1:** January - February
- **Spring 2:** March - April
- **Summer 1:** April - May
- **Summer 2:** June - July

#### Typical Year 4 Progression Example
| Term | Focus Areas |
|------|-------------|
| Autumn | Place value (4-digit numbers); addition/subtraction (columnar to 4 digits); multiplication/division (tables to 12x12, formal written x) |
| Spring | Fractions and decimals (hundredths, equivalents, add/subtract); measurement (perimeter, area by counting, time) |
| Summer | Geometry (classification, angles, symmetry, coordinates); statistics (bar charts, time graphs); consolidation |

**Note:** The UK curriculum sets year-end expectations but does not mandate a specific within-year progression. Schools and textbook schemes determine their own sequencing. The most common approach (influenced by schemes like White Rose Maths) follows the pattern above.

### 5.3 Key Differences in Within-Year Progression

| Aspect | France | UK |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Official period structure | 5 periods mandated with progressive expectations | Year-end objectives; schools decide sequencing |
| Number range expansion | Explicitly staged by period (e.g., CP: 10->59->100) | Not officially staged within year |
| Algorithm introduction | Timed precisely (e.g., "subtraction posed no later than P3 of CE1") | Schools decide when to introduce formal methods |
| Fluency benchmarks | Timed tests with specific targets per period | Year-end expectations; MTC in Year 4 |
| Curriculum documents | Very prescriptive about progression within year | Prescriptive about year-end outcomes |
