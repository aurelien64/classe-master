*ML5:* "Compare: 345,678 ___ 354,678" Answer: 345,678 < 354,678

*ML10:* "What number is 10,000 more than 394,567?" Answer: 404,567

**Common mistakes:**
- Reading 145,230 as "un million quarante-cinq mille..." (confusing 6-digit with 7-digit)
- When comparing, stopping at the first digit: 345,678 vs 354,678 -- both start with 3, must check second digit
- Adding 10,000: getting confused when digit crosses from 9 to 0 (394,567 + 10,000 = 404,567, not 394,567)
- Non-standard decomposition: not recognizing 345,000 + 678 = 345,678

**Common mistakes:**
- In 3-digit x 1-digit: forgetting to carry from ones to tens, or tens to hundreds
- Writing partial results incorrectly (356 x 6: 6x6=36, carry 3; 6x5=30+3=33, carry 3; 6x3=18+3=21 -> 2136)
- In 2-digit x 2-digit: not understanding why the second partial product is shifted left (x10)

*ML10:* "A teacher has 275 stickers to share equally among 8 students. How many does each get? How many are left?" Answer: 275 = 8 x 34 + 3. Each gets 34, 3 left over.

**Common mistakes:**
- Quotient estimation: choosing a quotient that is too large (e.g., 275/8: trying 35 -> 35x8=280 > 275, must use 34)
- Remainder >= divisor (not dividing enough times)
- Not verifying: q x b + r = a
- In word problems: forgetting to state both quotient AND remainder when both are needed

*ML10:* "Place 7/4 on the number line from 0 to 2." Answer: Between 1 and 2, at 1 and 3/4

**Common mistakes:**
- Unit fraction comparison: thinking 1/5 > 1/3 because 5 > 3
- Not recognizing that 4/4 = 1 or 8/8 = 1
- Placing 7/4 as 0.74 on the number line instead of 1.75
- Equivalence: not understanding why 2/4 = 1/2 without visual support

*ML10:* "What number is 100 less than 400,023?" Answer: 399,923

**Common mistakes:**
- "cent" in "deux cent trente-quatre mille" -- writing 200,34,567
- Standard decomposition: forgetting a place value (omitting the 80 in 456,789)
- Subtracting 100 from 400,023: not managing the borrow across multiple zeros -> 399,923
- Confusing "100 less" with "1,000 less"

*ML10:* "A farmer plants 48 rows of 27 trees. How many trees in total?" Answer: 48 x 27 = 1,296

**Common mistakes:**
- Not shifting the second partial product (writing 34x10 as 340 but placing it in the ones column)
- Adding partial products: 238 + 340 -- carrying errors in the addition step
- Confusing which digit to multiply by first
- In word problems: not identifying that rows x trees-per-row = total

*ML10:* "Find the number that is 50,000 less than 903,210." Answer: 853,210

**Common mistakes:**
- 6-digit numbers: difficulty with "six cent vingt-trois mille" vs "six mille deux cent trente"
- Rounding 876,543 to nearest 10,000: looking at the thousands digit (6 >= 5, so round up to 880,000)
- Subtracting from numbers with zeros: 903,210 - 50,000 requires borrowing
- Confusing place value positions in 6-digit numbers

*ML10:* "Order from smallest to largest: 3.8, 3.1, 3.5, 3.9" Answer: 3.1 < 3.5 < 3.8 < 3.9

**Common mistakes:**
- Writing 3/10 as 0.03 instead of 0.3
- Thinking 3.8 > 3.12 "because 8 > 12" (not applicable at this stage but emerges)
- Placing 4.7 closer to 4 than to 5 (not understanding that 0.7 is more than half)
- Confusing decimal comma (French: 3,8) with thousands separator

**CRITICAL -- Decimals pedagogy:**
- Start with MONEY context: EUR 2.50 = 2 euros and 50 centimes = 2 euros and 5 tenths of a euro
- Use shaded bar models divided into 10 equal parts
- Connect explicitly: 1/10 = 0.1 = one tenth
- Progress to abstract only after concrete understanding is solid

**Common mistakes:**
- Equivalence: multiplying numerator but not denominator (2/3 -> 4/3 instead of 4/6)
- Adding fractions: adding both numerators AND denominators (3/5 + 4/5 = 7/10)
- Not recognizing that 7/5 > 1 and should be expressed as mixed number
- Same-numerator comparison: thinking 3/5 > 3/8 (correct) but struggling to explain why

### SL5 -- CM1-MSR: Measurement (Area introduction)

**Skill:** Understand area as the space inside a shape. Count unit squares to find area. Begin area of rectangles. Distinguish area from perimeter.

| Parameter | ML1 | ML3 | ML5 | ML7 | ML10 |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Area concept | Count full squares | Count full squares | Count full + half squares | Rectangle formula intro | Rectangle formula |

| Time per Q (s) | 20 | 18 | 15 | 15 | 12 |

**Example questions:**

*ML1:* "Count the squares inside this rectangle." (3 x 4 grid shown) Answer: 12 square units

*ML5:* "An L-shaped figure on a grid has 5 full squares and 2 half squares. What is its area?" Answer: 6 cm2

*ML10:* "A garden is 12 m long and 8 m wide. What is its area? What is its perimeter?" Answer: Area = 96 m2, Perimeter = 40 m

**Common mistakes:**
- Confusing area and perimeter (the most common error at this stage)
- Counting squares: miscounting when shapes have irregular edges
- Area formula: computing length + width instead of length x width
- Units: writing cm instead of cm2 for area
- Half squares: counting each half square as a full square

**CRITICAL -- Area pedagogy:**
- Start with COUNTING SQUARES on a grid
- Physically cover shapes with unit square tiles if possible
- Only after counting is fluent, show that counting gives same result as length x width
- Always ask "Is this about the space inside (area) or the distance around (perimeter)?"

*ML5:* "384 / 6 = ?" Answer: 64

*ML10:* "A florist has 847 roses to make bouquets of 9 roses each. How many full bouquets? How many roses left over?" Answer: 847 = 9 x 94 + 1. So 94 bouquets and 1 rose left.

**Common mistakes:**
- Long division procedure: not knowing where to start (how many digits in the quotient?)
- Quotient digit estimation: trying 384/6 -- does 6 go into 38? Yes, 6x6=36, write 6. Bring down 4. 24/6=4. Common error: trying 7 first (6x7=42>38)
- Forgetting to bring down the next digit
- Not checking that remainder < divisor
- In word problems: reporting quotient but forgetting remainder, or vice versa

*ML10:* "Order: 4.5, 4.08, 4.52, 4.1, 4.09" Answer: 4.08 < 4.09 < 4.1 < 4.5 < 4.52

**Common mistakes:**
- Writing 47/100 as 0.047 instead of 0.47
- Comparing 4.5 and 4.52: thinking 4.5 < 4.52 is obvious (correct) but then thinking 4.5 > 4.8 "because 50 > 8"
- Comparing 4.1 and 4.08: thinking 4.08 > 4.1 because 08 vs 1, or 4.1 > 4.08 because "1 > 08"
- Key misconception: treating digits after decimal point as a separate whole number
- Not understanding that 4.1 = 4.10

*ML10:* "13/20 - 7/20 = ?" Answer: 6/20 = 3/10

**Common mistakes:**
- Adding denominators: 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/10 (WRONG -- denominators stay the same)
- Not converting improper fraction to mixed number when result > 1
- Subtraction: not checking that the first fraction is larger than the second

**Common mistakes:**
- kg to g: writing 3 kg 250 g as 3,250 kg instead of 3,250 g
- Area vs perimeter confusion (persistent error)
- L-shaped rooms: not decomposing correctly, or subtracting the wrong rectangle
- Forgetting units in the answer (writing 135 instead of 135 cm2)

*ML10:* "2,345 / 7 = ? remainder ?" Answer: 335 remainder 0 (2,345 = 7 x 335)

**Common mistakes:**
- 4-digit division: not managing the first partial division correctly (how many times does 7 go into 2? It doesn't. Into 23? 3 times with remainder 2.)
- Forgetting to write a zero in the quotient when a partial division gives 0
- Division by 10: 350 / 10 = 35 (correct), but students may write 350 / 10 = 3.5 (also correct but not expected here)
- Not verifying the result

**Example questions:**

*ML1:* "EUR 3.40 + EUR 2.50 = ?" Answer: EUR 5.90

*ML5:* "12.75 + 8.48 = ?" Answer: 21.23

*ML10:* "45.30 - 27.85 = ?" Answer: 17.45

**Common mistakes:**
- Not aligning decimal points in column format (most critical error)
- Adding 12.75 + 8.48: treating as 1275 + 848 = 2123 but placing decimal wrong -> 212.3 or 2.123
- Subtracting: borrowing across the decimal point (45.30 - 27.85: need to borrow in hundredths AND tenths)
- Writing 5.9 instead of 5.90 (equivalent, but may cause confusion in column method)

*ML5:* "11/12 - 5/12 = ?" Answer: 6/12 = 1/2

*ML10:* "1 3/8 + 2 5/8 = ?" Answer: 3 8/8 = 4

**Common mistakes:**
- Still adding denominators (persistent error: 3/7 + 2/7 = 5/14)
- Simplification: not recognizing 6/12 = 1/2
- Mixed number addition: adding whole parts and fraction parts separately is correct, but forgetting to convert if fraction part > 1 (3/8 + 5/8 = 8/8 = 1, so 1+2+1 = 4)
- 1 3/8 as an improper fraction: writing 13/8 instead of 11/8

*ML5:* "2,789 / 7 = ? remainder ?" Answer: 398 remainder 3 (or 398 3/7)

*ML10:* "Is 4,536 divisible by 9? Explain." Answer: Yes, because 4+5+3+6 = 18, and 18 is divisible by 9.

**Common mistakes:**
- 4-digit division: zero in the quotient (1,236 / 4: 12/4=3, 3/4=0 remainder 3, 36/4=9 -> quotient is 309, not 39)
- Remainder as fraction: writing 3/7 of the remainder correctly but sometimes inverting to 7/3
- Divisibility by 9: forgetting to sum ALL digits
- Divisibility by 3: similar digit-sum rule but students may confuse with the rule for 9

*ML10:* "A runner completes 3 laps: 2 min 34.56 s, 2 min 41.78 s, and 2 min 38.92 s. What is the total time for the 3 laps?" Answer: 34.56 + 41.78 + 38.92 = 115.26 seconds = 7 min 55.26 s (or accept 115.26 s if context is just the seconds)

**Common mistakes:**
- Aligning decimals: still the most common source of errors
- Mixed decimal places: adding 23.4 + 16.35 -- must treat 23.4 as 23.40
- Borrowing across the decimal point
- In word problems: extracting decimal numbers from text and setting up the correct operation

*ML10:* "What is 3/5 of 45?" Answer: 45 / 5 = 9, then 9 x 3 = 27

**Common mistakes:**
- Fraction-decimal conversion: memorization needed for common equivalences (1/4 = 0.25 is hard to derive)
- Fraction of a quantity: dividing by numerator instead of denominator (3/5 of 45: doing 45/3 instead of 45/5)
- Order of operations for fraction of a quantity: must divide FIRST, then multiply
- Adding fractions with denom 15-20: larger numbers lead to more arithmetic errors

*ML5:* "Classify this triangle: it has one right angle and two different side lengths." Answer: Right triangle (triangle rectangle)

*ML10:* "Draw a line through point P that is parallel to line AB." (construction question)

**Common mistakes:**
- Confusing perpendicular and parallel
- Triangle classification: not checking all three properties (angles AND sides)
- Circle: confusing radius and diameter (diameter = 2 x radius)
- Symmetry: flipping across the wrong axis
- Parallel line construction: not using set square correctly

*ML10:* "Without calculating exactly, estimate 789 x 42." Answer: approximately 800 x 40 = 32,000

**Common mistakes:**
- Large number reading: "huit cent" vs "huit cents" (agreement rules in French)
- Rounding to nearest 100: 456,789 -> look at tens digit (8 >= 5), round up to 456,800
- Estimation: not rounding to easy-to-multiply numbers

*ML1:* "34.56 + 12.78 = ?" Answer: 47.34

*ML5:* "200.00 - 156.75 = ?" Answer: 43.25

*ML10:* "A ribbon costs EUR 3.45 per metre. How much do 10 metres cost? If you pay with a EUR 50 note, how much change do you get?" Answer: 3.45 x 10 = 34.50; change = 50.00 - 34.50 = 15.50

**Common mistakes:**
- Subtracting from round numbers: 200.00 - 156.75 requires multiple borrows
- Multiplying by 10: 3.45 x 10 = 34.5 (moving decimal), students may write 3.450
- Multi-step: losing track of intermediate results
- Not writing EUR or units in the final answer

| Time per Q (s) | 12 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |

**Example questions:**

*ML1:* "9/15 + 4/15 = ?" Answer: 13/15

*ML5:* "2 5/8 - 1 3/8 = ?" Answer: 1 2/8 = 1 1/4

*ML10:* "What is 4/5 of 350?" Answer: 350 / 5 = 70, then 70 x 4 = 280

**Common mistakes:**
- Adding with larger denominators: arithmetic errors in the numerators
- Mixed number subtraction: borrowing from the whole number (e.g., 3 1/4 - 1 3/4)
- Simplification: not finding the GCD (8 and 2 share factor 2, so 2/8 = 1/4)
- Fraction of quantity: multiplying first then dividing (leads to larger intermediate numbers and more errors)

**Example questions:**

*ML1:* "Convert 5.4 km into metres." Answer: 5,400 m

*ML5:* "A rectangular field is 120 m long and 85 m wide. Calculate its area in m2 and its perimeter." Answer: Area = 10,200 m2, Perimeter = 410 m

*ML10:* "A train departs at 08h47 and arrives at 11h23. The journey includes a 15-minute stop. How long is the actual travel time?" Answer: Total time = 2 h 36 min. Travel time = 2 h 36 min - 15 min = 2 h 21 min.

**Common mistakes:**
- km to m: writing 5.4 km = 540 m instead of 5,400 m
- Area of large rectangles: multiplication errors with 3-digit numbers
- Time: crossing the hour boundary (08h47 to 11h23: first to 09h00 is 13 min, then 2h00 to 11h00, then 23 min = 2h 36 min)
- Not reading the question carefully (area vs perimeter, travel time vs total time)

**Example questions:**

*ML1:* "A library has 3,456 books. It receives 2 deliveries of 128 books each. How many books does it have now?" Answer: 128 x 2 = 256, then 3,456 + 256 = 3,712

*ML5:* "A school has 324 students divided equally into 9 classes. Each class needs 4 textbooks per student. How many textbooks are needed in total?" Answer: 324 / 9 = 36 students per class, 36 x 4 = 144 textbooks per class, 144 x 9 = 1,296 textbooks (or 324 x 4 = 1,296)

*ML10:* "A baker makes 480 croissants. He sells 3/4 of them at EUR 1.20 each and donates the rest. How much money does he earn?" Answer: 3/4 of 480 = 360 croissants sold, 360 x 1.20 = EUR 432.00

**Common mistakes:**
- Multi-step: solving only part of the problem
- Not identifying all the steps needed before starting
- Using the wrong intermediate result in the next step
- In fraction word problems: not connecting "3/4 of 480" to the computation 480 / 4 x 3

*ML5:* "What is -3 + 5?" Answer: 2

*ML10:* "Estimate 876 x 53. Then calculate the exact answer and compare." Answer: Estimate: 900 x 50 = 45,000. Exact: 876 x 53 = 46,428. Close!

**Common mistakes:**
- Ordering when multiple numbers share leading digits: need systematic place-by-place comparison
- Negative numbers: -3 + 5 -- students may think the answer is -8 (adding instead of moving right on number line)
- Roman numerals: M = 1,000 confusion with metric prefix
- Estimation: choosing poor rounding values that make the estimate too far from the exact answer

**Common mistakes:**
- Speed pressure leading to careless carry errors
- Multiples of 25: not recognizing the pattern (25, 50, 75, 100, 125...)
- Word problems: comparing result to a target number correctly
- Large multiplications: running out of space in written work

*ML10:* "A school trip costs EUR 2,340. If 9 classes share the cost equally, how much does each class pay? Is there any amount left?" Answer: 2,340 / 9 = 260 exactly. Each class pays EUR 260. No remainder.

**Common mistakes:**
- Large dividend division: managing 4+ digit quotients
- Zero in the quotient: must be written (e.g., 4,032 / 4 = 1,008, not 18)
- Remainder as fraction: the fraction is remainder/divisor, not divisor/remainder
- Divisibility shortcut: using divisibility rules to predict before computing

### SL10 -- CM1-DEC: Decimals (Complete CM1 mastery)

| Parameter | ML1 | ML3 | ML5 | ML7 | ML10 |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Operations | Add + subtract | Add + subtract | All + multiply by 10/100 | All operations | All operations |
| Range | 0.01-999.99 | 0.01-999.99 | 0.01-999.99 | 0.01-999.99 | 0.01-999.99 |

**Example questions:**

*ML1:* "78.45 - 33.67 = ?" Answer: 44.78

*ML5:* "Which is larger: 0.7 or 0.65?" Answer: 0.7 (because 0.70 > 0.65)

*ML10:* "A runner's times for 4 laps are: 1 min 12.34 s, 1 min 08.76 s, 1 min 15.02 s, 1 min 09.88 s. What is the total time?" Answer: 12.34 + 8.76 + 15.02 + 9.88 = 46.00 seconds for the fractional parts; 4 minutes + 46.00 seconds = 4 min 46.00 s

**Common mistakes:**
- Comparing 0.7 and 0.65: thinking 0.65 > 0.7 because 65 > 7 (critical conceptual error)
- Adding multiple decimals: alignment and carry tracking
- Mixed units in word problems: keeping track of minutes and seconds separately
- Not simplifying 46.00 s -> just 46 s

*ML5:* "Convert 7/20 to a decimal." Answer: 0.35

*ML10:* "A tank holds 600 litres. It is 3/4 full. After using 2/5 of the water in the tank, how many litres remain?" Answer: 3/4 of 600 = 450 L in tank. 2/5 of 450 = 180 L used. 450 - 180 = 270 L remain.

**Common mistakes:**
- Simplification: 18/16 -- finding GCD of 18 and 16 is 2, so 9/8
- Converting 7/20 to decimal: 7/20 = 35/100 = 0.35 (multiply both by 5)
- Multi-step fraction word problems: the most challenging type at CM1 level
- Applying fraction operations in sequence: using the result of one fraction computation as input to the next

*ML5:* "Convert 4,567 g to kg and g." Answer: 4 kg 567 g

*ML10:* "A swimming pool is 25 m long, 12 m wide, and filled to 1.5 m deep. What volume of water does it hold in m3? If 1 m3 = 1,000 L, how many litres is this?" Answer: 25 x 12 x 1.5 = 450 m3 = 450,000 L

**Common mistakes:**
- Area vs perimeter (still occurs at end of year for some students)
- g to kg: placing the decimal correctly (4,567 g = 4.567 kg)
- Volume: extending area concept to 3 dimensions -- new and challenging
- Large unit conversions: 450 m3 to litres -- must know 1 m3 = 1,000 L

**Example questions:**

*ML1:* "A farmer has 3 fields. The first is 125 m x 80 m, the second is 95 m x 60 m, and the third is 110 m x 70 m. What is the total area of all three fields?" Answer: 10,000 + 5,700 + 7,700 = 23,400 m2

*ML5:* "A class of 28 students is organising a trip. The bus costs EUR 420 shared equally. Each student also pays EUR 8.50 for lunch. What is the total cost per student?" Answer: 420 / 28 = EUR 15 per student for bus. 15 + 8.50 = EUR 23.50 per student total.

*ML10:* "A water tank holds 2,400 litres. On Monday, 3/8 of the tank is used. On Tuesday, 250 litres are added. On Wednesday, 1/4 of the current amount is used. How many litres remain after Wednesday?" Answer: Monday: 3/8 of 2,400 = 900 L used, 2,400 - 900 = 1,500 L remain. Tuesday: 1,500 + 250 = 1,750 L. Wednesday: 1/4 of 1,750 = 437.5 L used, 1,750 - 437.5 = 1,312.5 L remain.

**Common mistakes:**
- Multi-step: losing track of the current state after each operation
- Fraction of a changing quantity: must use the CURRENT amount, not the original
- Decimal results from fraction operations (437.5) -- unexpected for students
- Not re-reading the question to ensure ALL parts are answered
- Rushing through and skipping verification
